Requirement Analysis and Design Document
Introduction
Custom IDE aimed to streamline the development of a pixel-art RPG game with the visual aesthetics of "Eastward" and gameplay mechanics resembling "Dark Souls" and "Zelda."
Objective
To create a user-friendly, efficient, and powerful environment for game development.
To offer seamless integration with MOAI for both code and asset management.
Features
Code Editor

Syntax highlighting for Lua and any other languages you'll be using.
Code completion and snippets for MOAI-specific functions.
Integrated terminal for running build commands and tests.
Asset Manager

Easy import and organization of game assets like sprites, maps, and sounds.
Preview and edit assets within the IDE.
Map and Environment Editor

Drag-and-drop interface to create and edit game maps.
Tools for defining collision, zones, and triggers.
AI and Character Testing

Simulate AI behavior in a controlled environment.
Test character mechanics, animations, and interactions.
Debugging and Profiling

Breakpoints, step-through, and variable inspection.
Performance analytics.
Version Control

Git integration for source code management.
Project Management

Task lists, milestones, and timelines.
User Interface
A clean, modular UI with dockable panels for each feature set.
Software Architecture
Front-end: You'll likely use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) if building atop Electron.
Back-end: Lua for MOAI-specific functionality, and Node.js if using Electron.
Libraries: MOAI SDK, Electron (if applicable), additional libraries for text editing, etc.
Dependencies
MOAI SDK, Node.js and npm (if using Electron), Git
Milestones and Timeline
Set up project structure and dependencies - 1 week
Develop the code editor - 2 weeks
Implement the asset manager - 2 weeks
... and so on
Testing Strategy
Unit tests for isolated functionality.
Integration tests for feature sets.
User testing for UI/UX.
Would you like to add or modify anything in this preliminary plan? After finalizing this, we can move on to setting up the project structure.
